Players can choose to press Enter for a random selection or input specific choices (1 for 'X' and 0 for 'O'). The dice roll is not just a functional aspect but is accompanied by ASCII art, enhancing the visual appeal.

Victory and Restart:
Upon successfully connecting three tokens, players are greeted with a triumphant victory message. The game allows players the option to play again or exit, providing a seamless and enjoyable gaming loop.
